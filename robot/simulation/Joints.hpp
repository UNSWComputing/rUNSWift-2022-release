     *   The Joints class provides a representation of simulated joints.
     *   Joint information received from the server will be held in an
     *   instance of this class, and joint commands sent to the server
     *   should be held in an instance of this class.
     *
     *   Libagent uses 25 joints but the sim only provides 22. The relationship
     *   between these sets of joints is defined below.
     *
     *   Libagent joint order:
     *     1. HeadYaw
     *     2. HeadPitch
     *     3. LShoulderPitch
     *     4. LShoulderRoll
     *     5. LElbowYaw
     *     6. LElbowRoll
     *     7. LWristYaw
     *     8. LHand
     *     9. LHipYawPitch
     *     10. LHipRoll
     *     11. LHipPitch
     *     12. LKneePitch
     *     13. LAnklePitch
     *     14. LAnkleRoll
     *     15. RHipRoll
     *     16. RHipPitch
     *     17. RKneePitch
     *     18. RAnkleRoll
     *     19. RAnklePitch
     *     20. RShoulderPitch
     *     21. RShoulderRoll
     *     22. RElbowYaw
     *     23. RElbowYaw
     *     24. RWristYaw
     *     25. RHand
     *
     *  Interestingly enough, the left leg has a HipYawPitch but the
     *  right leg does not.
     *
     *   NOTE: This is because on the Real Nao, the HipYawPitch joints
     *   are fused, meaning moving one of the joints to some angle n
     *   will result in the other HipYawPitch joint moving to the same
     *   angle. To deal with this, libagent hides the right HipYawPitch
     *   and just provides an interface to the left. I imagine that it
     *   simply mirrors the LHipYawPitch angle to RHipYawPitch.
     *
     *
     *  Looks like we have the following joints from the sim (22):
     *     1. NeckYaw           (hj1)
     *     2. NeckPitch         (hj2)
     *     3. LShoulderPitch    (laj1)
     *     4. LShoulderYaw      (laj2)
     *     5. LArmYaw           (laj3)
     *     6. LArmRoll          (laj4)
     *     7. RShoulderPitch    (raj1)
     *     8. RShoulderYaw      (raj2)
     *     9. RArmYaw           (raj3)
     *     10. RArmRoll         (raj4)
     *     11. LHipYawPitch     (llj1)
     *     12. LHipRoll         (llj2)
     *     13. LHipPitch        (llj3)
     *     14. LKneePitch       (llj4)
     *     15. LFootPitch       (llj5)
     *     16. LFootRoll        (llj6)
     *     17. RHipYawPitch     (rlj1)
     *     18. RHipRoll         (rlj2)
     *     19. RHipPitch        (rlj3)
     *     20. RKneePitch       (rlj4)
     *     21. RFootPitch       (rlj5)
     *     22. RFootRoll        (rlj6)
     *
     *
     *  The mapping from rUNSWift to simulation joints will be as follows:
     *     1. HeadYaw -> NeckYaw
     *     2. HeadPitch -> NeckPitch
     *     3. LShoulderPitch -> LShoulderPitch
     *     4. LShoulderRoll -> LShoulderYaw
     *     5. LElbowYaw -> LArmRoll
     *     6. LElbowRoll ->  LArmYaw
     *     7. MISMATCH: LWristYaw -> N/A
     *     8. MISMATCH: LHand -> N/A
     *     9. LHipYawPitch -> LHipYawPitch
     *     10. LHipRoll -> LHipRoll
     *     11. LHipPitch -> LHipPitch
     *     12. LKneePitch -> LKneePitch
     *     13. LAnklePitch -> LFootPitch
     *     14. LAnkleRoll -> LFootRoll
     *     15. MISMATCH: N/A -> RHipYawPitch
     *     16. RHipRoll -> RHipRoll
     *     17. RHipPitch -> RHipPitch
     *     18. RKneePitch -> RKneePitch
     *     19. RAnklePitch -> RFootPitch
     *     20. RAnkleRoll -> RFootRoll
     *     21. RShoulderPitch -> RShoulderPitch
     *     22. RShoulderRoll -> RShoulderYaw
     *     23. RElbowYaw -> RArmRoll
     *     24. RElbowRoll -> RArmYaw
     *     25. MISMATCH: RWristYaw -> N/A
     *     26. MISMATCH: RHand -> N/A
