/**
 * MotionAdapter - interfaces between Motion & rest of system via Blackboard
 *
 * The MotionAdapter is the controlling class for everything Motion. It reads
 * ActionCommands from the Blackboard, and SensorValues from its Touch instance.
 *
 * It then passes AC::Head, AC::Body & SensorValues to a Generator instance,
 * which processes them and determines the correct JointValues for the next DCM
 * cycle. In practice, the Generator will usually be a DistributorGenerator,
 * which will select the most appropriate Generator based on the AC's.
 *
 * These JointValues, plus AC::LED are passed to an Effector instance. The
 * effector actuates the joints and LEDs according to these instructions.
